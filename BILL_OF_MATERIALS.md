# Bill of materials

The major libraries I use are
### React
This is the web framework i choose. Its the most popular one on npm and the one that most webdevelopers know and use
### Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a styling framework / css, with components for things like buttons, forms, and color themes
### react-bootstrap
This is a bunch of components from Bootstrap, written in react, for easier use in logic, the "react" way
### monaco-editor
This is the editor, its the same one that vscode uses, and it is the base of vscode.
